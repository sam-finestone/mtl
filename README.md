# How to train temporal multi-task models when the data is partially annotated across time
MSc Project Code 

# Dataset

Using the pre-processed NYUv2 and Cityscape dataset found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/86nssgwm6hm3vkb/AACrnUQ4GxpdrBbLjb6n-mWNa?dl=0) which was evaluate by MTAN paper. They use the pre-computed ground-truth normals from [here](https://cs.nyu.edu/~deigen/dnl/). The raw 13-class NYUv2 dataset can be directly downloaded in this repo with segmentation labels defined in their repo. The pre-processing CityScapes dataset with 2, 7, and 19-class semantic labels (see their paper for more details) and (inverse) depth labels. The downloads:  [256x512, 2.42GB] version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vj349qgg57nthi9/AACdZmIuK-Qb_gP6w1HrA43ta?dl=0) and [128x256, 651MB] version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gaw6vh6qusoyms6/AADwWi0Tp3E3M4B2xzeGlsEna?dl=0).
